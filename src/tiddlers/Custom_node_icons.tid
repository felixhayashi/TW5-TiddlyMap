In TiddlyWiki you can assign icons to your tiddlers by referencing a [[locally stored image|Local images]] in the tiddler's `icon` field. This icon will also appear next to the tiddler's title. When TiddlyMap sees that a Tiddler has an icon field set, it will try to make use of it by displaying it as node icon in a graph. For a complete list of shipped TiddlyWiki images see: [[TiddlyWiki images as node icons]].

<i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle" /> As of [[v0.9.0|Version 0.9.x]] it is possible to use [[Font Awesome for TiddlyWiki]] and paste the icon code (e.g. `&#xf072;` or simply `f072`) into a tiddler field `tmap.fa-icon`. This icon, however, will only be displayed in the graph, not in the tiddler title. Also it is now possible to use [[group styles|Styling Nodes]] to assign an image to multiple nodes at once.

The map above is an example that shows some tiddlers that posses an icon. The world icon is a TiddlyWiki image assigned to the "World" Tiddler by creating an `icon` field in the tiddler and setting it to `$:/core/images/globe`. The plane icon is a Font Awesome icon that is assigned to the "Plane" Tiddler by creating a `tmap.fa-icon` field in the tiddler and setting it to `&#xf072;`.
