You can add [[Font Awesome|https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/]] to your wiki by using one of the sources below.

[[@tobibeer|https://github.com/tobibeer]] created a great reference page for how to employ Font Awesome with TiddlyWiki. I recommend you follow his instructions on how to install and use Font Awesome: http://tobibeer.github.io/tw/fa.

[[@TheDiveO|https://github.com/TheDiveO]] also created a Font Awesome plugin. See [[TW5FontAwesome Plugin|https://github.com/TheDiveO/TW5FontAwesome]]. However, his provided version is out of date.
