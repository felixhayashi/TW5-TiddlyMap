You can use TiddlyMap to organize your thesis or to keep track of what you are reading and how your literature interrelates.

In this example, icons are assigned to the nodes with the help of [[group styles|Styling Nodes]]. Group styles are simple rules that allow you to assign styles based on filters. Expressed in a simplified scheme e.g. `[tag[Literature]] â†’ Assign PDF Icon`.

<i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle" /> Yes, you can use Font Awesome icons as node icons!! See also [[Custom node icons]].

<i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle" /> Did you notice that the the icons for books and scientific papers are the same but have a different color? This is because the icon is assigned by the literature [[group style|Styling Nodes]] and the group style used for papers partially overrides the literature style by specifying another color. How does TiddlyMap know which style should be preferred? You can [[Prioritize group styles]]!
