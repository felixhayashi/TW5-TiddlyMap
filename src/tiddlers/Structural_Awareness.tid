\rules except wikilink

In case of TiddlyMap, this describes the extent to which TiddlyMap is able to make sense of the existing wiki structure (i.e. explicit and implicit relations between the tiddlers). 

Examples for progress in the realm of structural awareness:

* In version v0.7.10 TiddlyMap was programmed to understand that tags are a form of relationship and to potentially display them in a graph.
* In v0.8.2, TiddlyMap allows the user to register his/her own relationship fields with the help of [[Magic Edge-Type Namespaces]].
