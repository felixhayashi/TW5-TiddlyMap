!! Try to keep your maps small
Small maps are faster to process by TiddlyMap and are generally easier to work with.
If a map becomes to big, try to [[outsource nodes into another view|Moving nodes between graphs]]!

!!Use a small set of generic edge types in your wiki
This means: avoid creating different edge types that are highly synonymous like //has created//, //authored//, //created by//, //creator of//. Instead stick to one name that is most suitable and generic.

!! Prefer generic node styles over specific node styles.
With all the [[different styling levels|Styling Nodes]], you'll save yourself some time if you use global styles whenever possible, especially global group styles. For example, if you have tiddlers that represent pieces of literature, then create a //node group// that adds a book icon to all these nodes â€“ instead of styling all literature nodes individually.
