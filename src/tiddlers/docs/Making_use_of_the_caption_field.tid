title: Making use of the caption field

To avoid having your valuable graph space covered by large titles, you can set caption fields in your tiddlers, which are used by ~TiddlyMap as node labels instead of the titles.

To support the semantic of the graph, you can define a description field in your tiddler, which will be displayed as tooltip once you hover a node. If you do not specify a description, the title is used as fallback to be displayed in the tooltip.

It should be highlighted that the caption fields value will be treated as wikitext and rendered as text/plain. So you can add e.g. `<<now>>` as caption text as demonstrated below.

<$tiddlymap view="Caption field example" ></$tiddlymap>

Please active the graph (via a click) and move with your mouse over the nodes. One node doesn't have a description so the title is displayed as tooltip instead. The other node has a description field, which is consequently displayed as tooltip.
