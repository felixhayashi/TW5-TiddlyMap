title: Representation and storage of nodes

Each node in a graph corresponds to a tiddler. Therefore, creating a new node in the map editor will necessarily result in the creation of a new tiddler and clicking on a node, will open that tiddler.

Node information is stored at two different levels. Some information, like the //label//, //color// or //icon//, is directly drawn from the tiddler and its fields since this information is also useful when not using ~TiddlyMap. Thus, it is kept with the tiddler itself.

Another part of the information is stored outside since it only makes sense in a graph context. More specifically, it is information that belongs to each different view. This information is stored in different system tiddlers that internally have the specific view path as prefix.

For example the node positions of a view are stored in a position-store that is exclusively owned and referenced by this view.
