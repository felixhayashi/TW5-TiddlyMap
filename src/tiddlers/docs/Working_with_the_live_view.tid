The //live view// shows you the surrounding neighbourhood of the tiddler that is currently focussed.

Just open the //live tab// in your sidebar and start scrolling down the list of currently opened tiddlers in your story river. If you add connections from the currently focussed tiddler via the [[The Quick-Connect Mechanism]], you can immediately see the results in the //live view//.
