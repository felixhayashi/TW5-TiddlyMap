!! Incompatibilities to previous versions

//Where is my tag filter?//

The view does not use tags anymore as filters but offers you a textfield
instead where you can enter your custom tw-filter. This means you have
to add the tags to the filter again.

//Why are my private edges public now?//

This is a side effect as I completely changed the way private edges work. Sorry, you need to rebuild your edges again if you want them to be private.
