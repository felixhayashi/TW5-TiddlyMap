Important Bugfixes
----------------------------

### v0.9.20

* Fixes #185: Deleting / renaming node-types doesn't work
* Fixes #184: Since v0.9.16 renaming views doesn't work anymore

### v0.9.19

* Creating a node type resulted in the creation of a tiddler with the
  same title as the id of the type.

### v0.9.18

* The TiddlyMap tiddler toolbar button produced an error.
  
### v0.9.17

* Added guards against
  https://github.com/Jermolene/TiddlyWiki5/issues/2025:
  Adding tiddler programmatically without text field causes serious
  recursion error in nodejs mode.

### v0.9.16

* Fixed bug that renaming an element type didn't work.
* Reintroduced the closing tag for the widget generator. It caused
  trouble to have tiddlymap widget's without closing tag.
* Showing correct timestamps now in the element-type manager.

### v0.9.15

* Further improved the fix for #177. This time also for static setups.

### v0.9.13

* Hide TM tiddler toolbar button when tiddler is a system tiddler.
* Fixes #176: Static HTML export of tiddler with embedded graph.
* Fixed small bug where when exiting fullscreen while being in draft
  mode the draft removal didn't remove the tiddler from the river.
* Fixes #177: Prevent nodes from floating far away when added to the
  canvas using a filter.
* Fixed bug where connection to non existent edge via message threw
  an exception. Related to #171.
* Fixed small bug where it was possible to paste nodes into the live
  view

### v0.9.12

* Fixes #175: Clicking on an element in the selectbox in the TM
  tiddler toolbar dropdown closes the dialog bug
  
### v0.9.11

* Fixes #174: Not all edges are displayed in live view and in the
  TMap toolbar button.

### v0.9.10

* Fixed bug that select style was not assigned when dragging a node.

### v0.9.9

* Adding node borders is now allowed and working.
* Node selection now works with correct styles being set (finally!)

### v0.9.8

* Fixed installation issues: In new wikis, the config was not read
  because the getTiddlerData function was used on tiddlers that
  were not marked as data tiddlers.
* By accident a wrong edge filter was added to the default view. wtf?
* Fixed bug that a node inserted with the adapter was not immediately
  inserted into the node-index, only after refresh!

### v0.9.6

* In v0.9.5 I introduced a very ugly node highlighting. Removed! :)
* Fixes #172: Keylisteners of the clipboard feature swallow letters.
* Fixed some visjs css

### v0.9.5

* Style relicts made it into the graph when in live view

### v0.9.4

* Editor was not working correctly

### v0.9.3

* Fixed bug that was introduced with v0.9.1: No alerts anymore
  that contain questions whether to cancel the draft or not.
* Fixed bug that node filters couldn't be deleted
* Fixed wrong modal css in mobile
* Fixed a critical bug that assigned new ids when upgrading from
  very early versions (where users could manually define the tmap id
  field). This happened because "tmap.id" is now always used as id
  field.

### v0.9.2

* Fixed bug that null labels where displayed for edges.
* Added safeguard to prevent that multiline editors allowed newlines
  to be written into single line fields (with regard to the
  type manager).
  See: https://github.com/Jermolene/TiddlyWiki5/issues/1955

### v0.9.1

* Fixes that a user could enter an empty view name during rename
* Fixes #154: Using icons might cause false font color
* Fixes error when pressing the save button in type manager when no
  type is loaded
  
Incompatibilities to previous versions
----------------------------

### v0.9.0
